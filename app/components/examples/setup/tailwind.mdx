### Tailwind CSS integration

Since we use various PostCSS plugins like autoprefixer, it is preferable to
install Tailwind CSS as a PostCSS plugin.

- Install PostCSS with tailwind and autoprefixer -

  ```
  npm install -D postcss-cli postcss tailwindcss autoprefixer
  ```

- Create a Tailwind CSS config file at root of the project named
  '**_tailwind.config.js_**' with following contents -

  ```js
  module.exports = {
    mode: 'jit',
    purge: ['./app/**/*.{js,jsx}'],
    theme: {
      extend: {}
    },
    variants: {},
    plugins: []
  };
  ```

- Create a PostCSS config file at root of the project named
  '**_postcss.config.js_**' with following contents -

  ```js
  module.exports = {
    plugins: {
      tailwindcss: {},
      autoprefixer: {}
    }
  };
  ```

- Create a styles folder at the root of the project. Inside the folder create a
  CSS file named **_tailwind.css_**. This will be the folder we use to create
  the final CSS files generated by tailwind to be imported in our project.

  <img
    alt='CSS Folder Structure'
    src='/images/examples/setup/tailwind/styles-folder.png'
  />

  Add following contents inside the created CSS file -

  ```css
  @tailwind base;
  @tailwind components;
  @tailwind utilities;
  ```

  This will import tailwind in the created css file.

- Add following scripts inside **_package.json_** -

  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "dev:css": "postcss styles --base styles --dir app/styles -w",
    "build:css": "postcss styles --base styles --dir app/styles --env production",
    "build": "remix build",
  ```

  We can now run these scripts to generate tailwind styles for our project.

- According to above two scripts, postcss will look into the styles folder,
  process the css files and generate the final css files inside app/styles
  folder.

  Those final css files can then be imported and linked into our project.

  **_root.jsx_**

  ```jsx
  import tailwindStylesUrl from '~/styles/tailwind.css';

  export const links = () => [{ rel: 'stylesheet', href: tailwindStylesUrl }];
  ```

- Now we can use commands 'npm run dev:css' and 'npm run build:css' to generate
  classes for development and production respectively.

  To avoid needing seperate terminals for generating css and starting
  development server, we can use concurrently-

  ```
  npm install -D concurrently
  ```

  Modify 'dev' and 'build' scripts in package.json as following -

  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "build": "npm run build:css && remix build",
    "build:css": "postcss styles --base styles --dir app/styles --env production",
    "dev": "concurrently \"npm run dev:css\" \"remix dev\"",
    "dev:css": "postcss styles --base styles --dir app/styles -w"
  ```

  Now we can directly run 'npm run dev' or 'npm run build' and our styles will
  be generated simultaneously.

- To be able to style form elements using tailwind, we will need
  '@tailwindcss/forms' plugin -

  ```
  npm install @tailwindcss/forms
  ```

  Modify tailwind.config.js as following to include Tailwind CSS Forms plugin.

  ```js
  variants: {},
  plugins: [require('@tailwindcss/forms')]
  ```
